Andrew Pyle \| Student \| UA Little Rock

*M.S. Information Science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (Little Rock, AR USA)  
B.S. Molecular and Cellular Biology - Harding University (Searcy, AR USA)*

I'm a technology enthusiast studying for a MS in Information Science. I'm interested in languages, statistics, and building things. I am a single-board computer enthusiast. I would just say Raspberry Pi, but they aren't the only act anymore. ([Orange Pi](http://www.orangepi.org/)!)

I love the outdoors, photography, international travel, and growing houseplants!
