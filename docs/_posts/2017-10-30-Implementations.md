This page houses a collection of other natural language generation implementations available. I will add to this page as I find new ones.

## Task-Based
1. [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/)
1. [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/)
1. [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/)

#### Issues
1. Chat-style orientation doesn't provide for one-off "tweet-thought" generation.
1. Frame-based response rules work for accomplishing tasks, but not for idiosyncratic text generation.
1. No provision for style of responses.

## Artificial-Intelligence-Based
1. [Neural Net](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/lstm_generator_shakespeare.py)
1. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_chatbot)

#### Issues
1. Long Training times
1. Huge corpus requirements
1. Non-trivial to understand implementation
