After an approximately month-long revision and approval process, Drs. Romney (Advisor: History), Pierce (Information Science), and Agarwal (Information Science) have all given their approval to my project.

I will be meeting with my project adviser during the 2nd week of January to present prototypes and discuss the timeline for spring 2018.
