I have been looking through the [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) literature for articles about Natural Language Generation (NLG). Creating a program that can recreate the speech or writing patterns of a specific person is inherently a language generation problem. I am hoping to draw some inspiration from academic papers in the NLG field.

## Difficulties
However, after a few [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) searches, it seems that most of the papers available are of the old and classic variety, attempting to define and categorize the problem academically. I am having trouble zeroing in on papers that speak to my area in a practical way.
