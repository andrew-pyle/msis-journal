# The End
As this project established, a CFG is not robust enough to generate sentences which would be considered grammatical according to the rules of English. The probability of a good sentence is just too low.

However, there were some shining examples, and I'll leave the project with the best one.

This sentence was generated with the lowest-level-symbol approach. The tags [DT, NNPS, VBP, TO, VB, NN, .] yielded:

>'some Terrorists are to fix #AmericaFirst ?'

And that's all.
