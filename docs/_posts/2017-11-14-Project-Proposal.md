I have been collaborating with Drs. Romney (Advisor: History), Pierce (Information Science), and Agarwal (Information Science) on my project proposal. They have all received a copy of the document, and some suggestions have ben made. I expect at least one more round of edits and revisions. Due to each professor's travel schedule, email correspondence will be the best option for feedback and approval.

I hope to have the proposal approved this week or early next week, depending on Dr. Agarwal's schedule.
