# Adviser Found

Yesterday I spoke with [Dr. Charles Romney](http://ualr.edu/history/charles-romney/) about the [Personified Chat Bot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-24-First-Steps %}). He seemed very interested and agreed to be my MSIS Project adviser. The next step is to officially list him as my adviser in the UA Little Rock system. I'll also need to assemble 2 more faculty members, forming a committee of 3.

## Project Ideas
[Dr. Romney](http://ualr.edu/history/charles-romney/) and I discussed some potential paths for this [Personified Chat Bot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-24-First-Steps %}). The basic idea is to unify the features of a [Markov chain](https://hackernoon.com/from-what-is-a-markov-model-to-here-is-how-markov-models-work-1ac5f4629b71) and a [natural language generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation).

>Think Twitter bot version of Donald Trump

Given a corpus of text from a given speaker/writer/tweeter, this chat bot could generate text both according to natural English and according to the author's stylistic autograph. So maybe *Chat Bot* is a misnomer. Maybe this is more of a Twitter-targeted bot: *Personified TweetBot*.

One approach would use a [natural language parser](https://explosion.ai/blog/parsing-english-in-python) to bin the entire corpus into parts-of-speech, creating a repository of potential subjects, verbs, adjectives, etc. In parallel, a Markov chain algorithm could be assigning all the transition properties for the chosen n-gram of words. The part-of-speech "raw material" could then be utilized by a natural language generator to create many possible outputs, and the markov transition properties could determine the single output by selecting the alternative with the best fit to the corpus distribution.
