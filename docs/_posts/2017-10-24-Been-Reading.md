The past week for me has been mostly reading [Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) from Dan Jurafsky and James H Martin,
which I have [referenced before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-28-Jurafsky %}). Check the 
[Papers List]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers) to see everything I have been reading.

It seems that 3 main NLP concepts are candidates for a tweet generation system: Context-Free Grammar, Semantic Role labeling,
and Hidden Markov Model.

The pressing task is now creation of tenable architectures for generating a tweet!
