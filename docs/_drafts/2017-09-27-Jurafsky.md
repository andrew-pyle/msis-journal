Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin are writing *Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed.)* Many draft chapters are released [online](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). The [2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Speech-Language-Processing-Daniel-Jurafsky/dp/0131873210) of this textbook was released in 2008, and is an introductory text in the field of computational linguistics.


I'd like to summarize the current paradigms for dialog systems presented in [Ch. 29: Dialog Systems and Chatbots](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/29.pdf).


## Dialog System Paradigms
Jurafsky splits conversational agents/dialog systems into 2 functional categories:

  1. Task-Oriented Dialog Agents
  1. Chatbots

Task-Oriented dialog agents process and create natural language to accomplish a specific goal, while chatbots are typically designed to carry on conversations with humans in an unregulated manner.

## Chatbots
There are several strategies which chatbots commonly employ to generate natural language.

### Rule-Based
Rule-based chatbots rely on transformation rules and an input sequence to create output. One influential rule-based chatbot is the ELIZA system (Weizenbaum 1966). Here is the [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA).  

The [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) system worked in a psychological domain, ranking the features of the single human's conversant's input according rules. It then transformed the highest-ranked input feature or features according to another ruleset, creating output.

### Corpus-Based
Corpus-based chatbots rely on large bodies of human generated text rather than transformation rules. They have two main groups.

#### Information Retrieval


#### Supervised Machine Learning


## Task-Oriented Dialog Agents
