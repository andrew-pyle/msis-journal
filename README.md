# Markov + Text Generator
**Andrew Pyle** | Project | M.S. Information Science | UA Little Rock

This project aims to create a text generator program that will be able to recognizably reproduce the manner of speech of any specific human speaker/writer. It will combine the features of Markov-Chain transition state properties and the prinicples of natural language generation to produce idiosyncratic output based on a training corpus of an individual's writing or speech.

The project will satisfy the M.S. Project requirement at UA Little Rock. I will be actively working from Fall 2017 through Spring 2018. Check back often for progress!
